  <p>I specialize in tailoring and upholstering furniture of all kinds. Here are a few:</p><br>

  <p><strong>Majlis - traditional Arabic style seats</strong></p>
  <p>The fabric of your majlis can be switched out with the fabric you choose. Or an entirely new one can be made. This can also include matching majlis tables. This tends to be a majority of what previous customers have requested.</p><br>

    </div>
  <p><strong>Sofas and loveseats</strong></p>
  <p>The fabric of sofas can be changed or replaced. Instead of buying a whole new one, your sofa could look brand new with a fabric of your choice.</p><br>

  <p><strong>Valances and pelmets for curtains</strong></p>
  <p>A valance or pelmet can be made from scratch with various designs. This is a nice way to adorn your curtains and windows and beautify your living area.</p><br>
